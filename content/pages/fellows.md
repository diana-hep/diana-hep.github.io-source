Summary: DIANA Fellows

### DIANA Fellows

The DIANA Fellows program provides support for 4 graduate students each year to spend 3 months intensively developing software tools in conjunction with collaborating institutions. The graduate student should have a base stipend from their home institution. The DIANA Fellows program will provides travel and subsistence funds to support direct collaboration with others developing software tools for general use at a second institution. See the [Fellow Projects page](fellowprojects.html) for example projects of interest and details on how to propose your own project. For more information, contact [mike.sokoloff@uc.edu](mike.sokoloff@uc.edu).

### DIANA Undergraduate Fellow

A DIANA Undergraduate Fellow position is also available each year. The student will work 10-12 weeks during the summer, either developing or using data-intensive tools. The DIANA project will provide a stipend for the summer period and in some cases can provide additional travel/subsistence support if they work away from their home institution. For more information on the DIANA Undergraduate Fellow position contact [mike.sokoloff@uc.edu](mike.sokoloff@uc.edu).
