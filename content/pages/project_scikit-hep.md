### Project summary

The Scikit-HEP project is a community-driven and community-oriented project
with the aim of providing Particle Physics at large with a Python package
containing core and common tools. The project started in Autumn 2016
and is presently being prepared for an initial beta release.

The software package defines a set of five *pillars*, which are seen to embrace
all major topics involved in a physicist's work. These are:

- **Datasets**: data in various sources, such as ROOT, Numpy/Pandas, databases, wrapped in a common interface.
- **Aggregations**: e.g. histograms that summarize or project a dataset.
- **Modeling**: data models and fitting utilities.
- **Simulation**: wrappers for Monte Carlo engines and other generators of simulated data.
- **Visualization**: interface to graphics engines, from ROOT and Matplotlib to maybe even d3 or plot.ly.

Contributions and contributors from the community are most valuable and are a focus of attention
by the start-up team. Further details are to be found under the "Links" section below.


### Team

The project started with the following team made of DIANA members
collaborating with colleagues from the LHC experiments:

- Vanya Belyaev (ITEP, Moscow - LHCb experiment)
- Noel Dawe (University of Melbourne - ATLAS experiment)
- David Lange (Princeton University - CMS experiment, DIANA)
- Sasha Mazurov (University of Birmingham - LHCb experiment)
- Jim Pivarski (Princeton University - CMS experiment, DIANA)
- Eduardo Rodrigues (University of Cincinnati - DIANA, LHCb experiment)
