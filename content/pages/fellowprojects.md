Summary: DIANA Fellow Projects

### Proposing a Project 

  If you are interested in a DIANA Fellow position, you can propose a project.
In the proposal you should briefly describe the software development activity 
that you would like to pursue, and how that activity will enhance your
own and other people's research activities. Note also the intended software
project or person with whom you will collaborate and the location where
you would like to travel for that collaboration.
The proposal should be short, typically no more than 2-3 paragraphs.
Submit your project proposal by email to [mike.sokoloff@uc.edu](mike.sokoloff@uc.edu). In 2016, DIANA Fellow positions will be awarded in a rolling fashion 
based on submitted project proposals. 

  If you are involved in a software project used by the community and
have specific projects which could be of interest to potential DIANA 
Fellows, please send your ideas to [mike.sokoloff@uc.edu](mike.sokoloff@uc.edu).They can be listed as example projects in the list below.
