Summary: Fast ROOT IO Project

## Fast ROOT IO project

This project aims to improve the use of ROOT IO for HEP analysis users; primarily, we aim for mechanisms
that will speed up ROOT IO for these use cases.

### Implicit Multithreading

In ROOT 6.08, the ROOT team introduced the concept of Implicit Multi Threaded (IMT) mode.  When this is enabled,
the ROOT libraries will utilize multiple threads to for reading data.

This mode does _not_ change the APIs or allow the user to invoke the ROOT libraries from multiple threads in general
(hence the name _implicit_ multithreading).

We are working to expand the IMT mode to cover a large fraction of the ROOT IO API.

### Bulk API

The ROOT IO API is relatively heavyweight: types are determined at runtime and some APIs can result in a deep nest of virtual calls.
Further, ROOT must be invoked once per event, meaning this overhead happens for every event, _regardless_ of the complexity.

We are working on a new "bulk API" that allows many objects to be deserialized per call to ROOT, amortizing the overhead of the
ROOT IO API.

We view this as the first step toward implementing zero-copy IO: if the overhead of reading data is too high, the cost of the memory
copy is too small to be noticed.

### Compression Algorithms

By default, ROOT aggressively compresses its files utilizing a "best-of-breed" compression algorithm, `zlib`.  While a good choice
for a wide variety of use cases, we have been exploring various ways to improve the performance of the compression:

- *Alternate algorithms*: Some compression algorithms are tailored for decompression speed at the cost of compression speed or ratio;
  we are investigating whether ROOT should add support for these algorithms for cases where a file is read many times.
- *Random access*: Multiple events may get compressed together, meaning we must decompress many events to read a single one.  We
  are working to drop "restart markers" to allow true random access to individual events.
- *Faster =zlib=*: Various companies have developed significant patchsets to =zlib= to utilize modern CPU features for significant
  speedups.  These are not in wide use as the patches will cause crashes on older CPU models.  We are working to develop patches
  that work well across all CPU types.

### TTreeProcessor

A majority of ROOT-based analyses have a high level of parallelism: each event analyzed is independent of all others.  However,
the analysis itself is impelmented with a `for`-loop: the serializes the work.

The `TTreeProcessor` is an attempt to provide functional-like constructs to the traditional ROOT analysis.  The user provides the
"contents" of the for-loop, while the processor framework implements the parallelism.

Unlike successful prior projects like PROOF or PROOF-lite, the TTreeProcessor aims to expose modern C++11 interfaces that the
compiler can aggressively inline.  When combined with the bulk API, we believe this will eliminate expensive function calls in
the "hot path" of the analysis.
