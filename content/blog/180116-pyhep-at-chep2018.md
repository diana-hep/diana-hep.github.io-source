We are pleased to announce a new series of workshops initiated and supported by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF). The PyHEP "Python in HEP" workshops aim to provide an environment to discuss and promote the usage of Python in the HEP community at large.

The first workshop, PyHEP 2018, will be held as a pre-CHEP event in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 7-8 July 2018, just before the start of the CHEP2018 conference. It will focus on a review of where and how Python is used in our community. The workshop will be a forum for the participants, representatives of the community, to discuss topics around the areas of work identified in the HSF [Community White Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982). There will be ample time for discussion.

The agenda will be composed of plenary sessions dedicated to the following topics:
1. Historical perspective and overview
2. PyROOT and Python bindings
3. HEP python software ecosystem
4. Distribution and installation
5. Analysis frameworks
6. Python 2 versus 3
7. Open discussion on education and training

The preliminary agenda will be available on the [workshop indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/694818/) linked from the [PyHEP homepage](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/pyhep.html).

For travel and hotel information, please refer to the comprehensive information displayed on the [CHEP 2018 website](http://chep2018.org/).

Further information will be provided via the above links and also as part of the fothcoming CHEP bulletins.  In particular, registration will be available via the registration form for CHEP 2018.

Looking forward to seeing many of you in Sofia,
