We are proud to announce that DIANA/HEP has been funded by the National Science Foundation's [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817) (SI2) program. We are just kicking off the project, and will be updating these web pages and adding posts as we go along.

We have created [DIANA-HEP GitHub Organization](https://github.com/diana-hep)
